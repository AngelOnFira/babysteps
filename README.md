To setup the environment.

## Install graphviz

Some of the posts rely on graphviz, so install it.

## Using rbenv

I've used rbenv in the past, though the most recent time I didn't bother.

* install rbenv
* install rbenv-build
* build Ruby using `rbenv install`

As an alternative, on Debian:

* `sudo apt-get install ruby-full`

## Install jekyll

See the jekyll directions

* `gem install jekyll bundler`

## Setup bundler

Go to babysteps directory and run `bundle update --bundler`
