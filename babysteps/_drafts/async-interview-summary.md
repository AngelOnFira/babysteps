Over the course of [async interviews] series, I've been interviewing
key people from various projects in the async world. In these
interviews, I've been trying to give a kind of survey over what
various people think we ought to be doing next. I hoped to find
elements of consensus, but also to strengthen and better inform my own
opinions. So I wanted to take a step back now to write a post that
lays out my current thoughts on async, both in terms of what we ought
to be prioritizing, but also in terms of the challenges I see in
getting there.
