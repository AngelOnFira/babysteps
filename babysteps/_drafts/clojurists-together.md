In [January], I wrote a blog post about the possibility of creating a Rust foundation. Since publishing that blog post, I've been talking to a number of folks involved various open source foundations and projects to get a better idea of the 'prior art' in this area. I am going to start posting summaries of these conversations in a series of blog posts. Also, if people have suggestions for other organizations that I should be talking to, I'd love to hear them.

Today's blog post is describing the structure of [Clojurists Together], and its based on a conversation that I had with Daniel Compton and Laurens Van Houtven from [Clojurists Together].

## History of Clojurists Together

[Clojurists Together] started around two years ago. Inspired by [Ruby Together], it had two goals:

* To be a legal entity behind the [Clojars project](https://clojars.org/).
* To help fund the development and maintainance of projects in the Clojure ecosystem.

## Deciding which projects to fund

Projects are funded on a quarterly basis. Each quarter, people make applications to receive funding. Those applications are reviewed by the 7-member *Clojurists Together Committee* which makes the ultimate decisions of which projects to fund.

Decisions are also informed by a survey that the committee sends out to the Clojurists Together membership. This survey asks about the kinds of projects that their members would like to see funded. It's not binding, but it's a helpful guide.

## Applying for funding

You can see the [details of the Clojurists Together application process](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/open-source/) here.  

Some details that I noted which seemed interesting:

* The application is pretty lightweight, and their example consist of only a few paragraphs of text.
* Projects are all funded at the same, fixed rate. In 2018, that rate was $1800 per month, but in 2019 it was $3000 per month. Two projects were funded each quarter.
* Projects are always funded for a 3 month term.
* While they prefer not to judge by 'number of hours', the expectation is that projects will take more than 15 hours/month, but less than 80 hours/month.
* The criteria are listed publicly, and they include the sort of things you would expect: the history of funding, the prominence of the project, comments from members, as well as the track record of the applicants.

They said they've been considering adding in the ability to request smaller grants.

## Membership and voting

I mentioned that the decisions about which projects to fund are made by the [Clojurists Together] committee. This committee is elected. Each year, half the seats are up for re-election. 

The voters in the election are the **members** of Clojurists Together. Every person or corporation who donates to Clojurists Together is a member, and every member gets one vote, regardless of the amount that they donate.

Besides participating in the election, members also receive the quarterly survey that I mentioned earlier, which asks after the sort of projects that they would like to see funded.

## Legal structure

Clojurists Together began its life as a member of the [Software Freedom Conservancy][SFC], but they are currently in the process of moving to an independent company. Serving on the Clojurists Together Committee is an unpaid position. They do hire a part-time admin to help follow-up on the payments and generally tackle adminstrative duties.
