This blog is where I intend to post up various half-baked ideas that
come up in the course of my research.  I am working at Mozilla on the
[Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org).  I called the blog
Baby Steps mostly because I couldn't up with good name, but also
because I feel like research is a process of taking tiny, incremental
steps towards something better, and because it will justify the
occasional picture of my daughter or two that I plan to throw in from
time to time.
